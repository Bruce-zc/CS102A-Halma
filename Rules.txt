The Rules
- Players randomly determine who will move first.
- Pieces can move in eight possible directions(orthogonally and diagonally).
- Each player's turn consists of moving a single piece of one's own color in one of the following plays(as in Figure):
   1. One move to an empty square:
      Place the piece in an empty adjacent square.
      This move ends the play.
   2. One or more jumps over adjacent pieces:
      An adjacent piece of any color can be jumped if there is an adjacent empty square on the directly opposite side of that piece.
      Place the piece in the empty square on the opposite side of the jumped piece.
      The piece that was jumped over is unaffected and remains on the board.
      After any jump, one may make further jumps using the same piece, or end the play.
- Once a piece has reached the opposing camp, a play cannot result in that piece leaving the camp.
- If the current play results in having every square of the opposing camp occupied by one's own pieces,  the acting player wins. Otherwise, play proceeds clockwise around the board.
